I'm a driven and curious software engineer with a strong foundation in full-stack development and a passion for crafting innovative, user-focused solutions. From designing seamless frontends to architecting robust backend systems, I enjoy bringing ideas to life through code.

👨‍🎓 I'm a BEng (Hons) Software Engineering graduate from the University of Westminster with hands-on experience from my internship at Axiata Digital Labs, where I worked on microservice-based enterprise applications using Java Spring Boot and RESTful APIs.

🌍 TourMe – An AR-based mobile travel guide to explore Sri Lanka interactively.

📚 AUnite – A smart educational platform with automated MCQ generation and learning modules.

💼 Company websites, dashboards, and admin panels across various stacks.
